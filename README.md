TinDog is a mockup dating website using Bootstrap front end library just to showcast my development skills using basic html, css and bootstrap.
This website is responsive for both desktop and mobile viewports done using bootstrap collumn grids and also a bit of @media queries are also used.
I have used z-indexing and positioning of the elements for maintaing a concurrent flow all over the site.
I have tried to keep this project readable and modular for anyone with basic developing knowledge.
Feel free to use the code or necessary files if you need to ever use for your work projects or assignments.
